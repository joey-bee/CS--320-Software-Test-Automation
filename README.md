How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The best way to ensure the code, program, or software is functional and secure is to have thourough testing to hep ensure it is functional as well as ensuring it is secure. It is important to continue testing in the early states which will allow the artist to find certain issues within the code in the beginning which will ensure them to locate any need for improvements sooner rather than later down the line. For one to ensure the code will function correclty and function as expected will help with the edge cases and will also show the author the software is secure and less likely to fail.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs, or the requirments of the program, can be used to create the many different components or required actions of the program. These requirements can be utilized as certain criteria during the testing to help confirm everything has been met within the code and system. I think the most important part is to understand the user needs first by reading them thoroughly and encouraging questions immediately to be asked and answered to help start the program off with a great start. 

How do I approach designing software?

The first part of my approach is to go over the requirments thoroughly and ask as many questions that may come to mind while going through the requirments. The next step for me is to break each part down into smaller groups or group together those that are related and then start to execute those within the coding. It is important to ensre there are unit tests as well as frequent "checkpoints" to ensure testing while construction is still under way to verify everything is going in the correct direction and working properly before getting to deep.
